In order to run project, run following commands
npm install
npm run start

Then it will automatically start the project from 3000 port and it will open default browser.


For the architectural choices I made;

I used react for managing components since I currently use it in my projects.
I used redux for single source of truth and managing states since state management is not easy without redux.
I used redux-saga middleware for async operations instead of thunk since it uses callback.
I used material ui 1.3 for react ui components since it is stable and used to do.
I used create-react-app for template project since it is easy to configure. (Webpack, express, babel, etc)
